# Day 1 Study Guide: Snowflake Core Concepts & Architecture

## üìö Overview
This study guide covers the fundamental concepts and architecture principles that form the foundation of Snowflake knowledge required for the SnowPro Core certification.

## üèóÔ∏è Snowflake Architecture Deep Dive

### Three-Layer Architecture

Snowflake's unique architecture separates compute, storage, and cloud services into three distinct layers:

#### 1. Database Storage Layer (Bottom Layer)
**Purpose:** Persistent data storage with automatic optimization

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Micro-partitions:** Data is stored in compressed, encrypted micro-partitions
- **Automatic Clustering:** Data organization for optimal query performance
- **Columnar Storage:** Efficient compression and query performance
- **Cross-Cloud Compatibility:** Works across AWS, Azure, and GCP

**Storage Features:**
- **Compression:** Automatic compression reduces storage costs
- **Encryption:** Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Durability:** Built-in replication and backup
- **Schema Evolution:** Support for schema changes without downtime

#### 2. Query Processing Layer (Compute Layer)
**Purpose:** Independent compute clusters for query execution

**Virtual Warehouses:**
- **Definition:** Named compute clusters that execute queries
- **Independence:** Multiple warehouses can run simultaneously
- **Scaling:** Can be resized dynamically (X-Small to 6X-Large)
- **Auto-Suspend/Resume:** Automatic resource management

**Warehouse Sizes:**
| Size | Servers | Credits/Hour | Use Case |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| X-Small | 1 | 1 | Development, light queries |
| Small | 2 | 2 | Small datasets, reporting |
| Medium | 4 | 4 | Regular analytics |
| Large | 8 | 8 | Large datasets, complex queries |
| X-Large | 16 | 16 | Heavy analytics workloads |
| 2X-Large | 32 | 32 | Very large datasets |
| 3X-Large | 64 | 64 | Massive parallel processing |
| 4X-Large | 128 | 128 | Extreme workloads |

**Multi-Cluster Warehouses:**
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically adds/removes clusters based on demand
- **Concurrency:** Handles multiple queries simultaneously
- **Queue Management:** Prevents query queuing during high demand
- **Enterprise Feature:** Available in Enterprise edition and above

#### 3. Cloud Services Layer (Top Layer)
**Purpose:** Manages authentication, metadata, optimization, and coordination

**Core Services:**
- **Authentication & Authorization:** User management and access control
- **Metadata Management:** Stores schema, statistics, and object definitions
- **Query Optimizer:** Generates optimal execution plans
- **Infrastructure Management:** Resource allocation and monitoring
- **Security Services:** Encryption, key management, and compliance

**Always-On Services:**
- Runs continuously across all Snowflake regions
- Minimal credit consumption for most operations
- Highly available and fault-tolerant

## üîÑ Architecture Comparison

### Traditional Database Architectures

#### Shared-Disk Architecture
**Characteristics:**
- Multiple compute nodes share the same storage system
- Storage is accessed through a storage area network (SAN)
- All nodes can read/write to the same data

**Advantages:**
- Simple data consistency model
- Easy to maintain data integrity
- Shared storage reduces duplication

**Disadvantages:**
- Storage becomes a bottleneck
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure
- Network contention for storage access

**Examples:** Oracle RAC, IBM DB2 with shared disk

#### Shared-Nothing Architecture
**Characteristics:**
- Each node has its own CPU, memory, and storage
- Data is partitioned across nodes
- Nodes communicate through network for distributed queries

**Advantages:**
- Linear scalability potential
- No single bottleneck
- Fault isolation
- Good for parallel processing

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex data partitioning
- Difficult to maintain consistency
- Data redistribution challenges
- Join operations across nodes are expensive

**Examples:** Teradata, Vertica, Amazon Redshift

### Snowflake's Shared-Data Architecture

**Innovation:** Combines the best of both worlds

**Key Principles:**
- **Shared Data:** All compute can access all data
- **Separated Compute:** Independent scaling of compute resources
- **Centralized Storage:** Single source of truth
- **Elastic Compute:** Dynamic resource allocation

**Benefits:**
- **Scalability:** Independent scaling of compute and storage
- **Performance:** Optimized for both OLTP and OLAP workloads
- **Simplicity:** No need to manage data partitioning
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay only for resources used
- **Concurrency:** Multiple workloads without interference

## üí∞ Pricing and Credit Model

### Credit-Based Pricing
**Credits:** Universal unit of consumption across all Snowflake services

**Credit Consumption:**
- **Compute:** Based on warehouse size and runtime
- **Storage:** Compressed data storage
- **Cloud Services:** Minimal consumption for metadata operations
- **Data Transfer:** Cross-region and cross-cloud transfers

**Warehouse Credit Rates:**
```
X-Small: 1 credit/hour
Small: 2 credits/hour
Medium: 4 credits/hour
Large: 8 credits/hour
X-Large: 16 credits/hour
2X-Large: 32 credits/hour
3X-Large: 64 credits/hour
4X-Large: 128 credits/hour
```

### Storage Pricing
- **Compressed Storage:** Billed monthly for average storage
- **Fail-safe Storage:** Additional 7 days of backup storage
- **Time Travel Storage:** Historical data retention costs

## üîê Security and Compliance

### Encryption
**At Rest:**
- AES 256-bit encryption for all data
- Automatic key rotation
- Customer-managed keys (CMK) support

**In Transit:**
- TLS 1.2+ for all connections
- End-to-end encryption
- Certificate-based authentication

### Access Control
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Hierarchical role structure
- Principle of least privilege
- Granular permissions

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
- Duo Security integration
- SAML SSO support
- Federated authentication

**Network Policies:**
